#Life Stress and Subsequent Illness Prediction
##Purpose
This Project is to be submitted in partial fulfilment of course requirements "Development of Data Products" part of The Johns Hopkins/Coursera, Certification in Data Science.
The topic of the project is the collection and real-time analysis (client feedback) of a Survey of Life Stress incidents with a view to prediction of risk of subsequent development of illness in the following 2 year period.
  
##Introduction and Backgraound  
  
This is a subject which has occupied many researchers since the sixties. The effectiveness in prediction has been highly variable with the model of the Social [Readjustment Rating Scale](https://github.com/medmatix/Dev_Data_Prod_Proj/blob/master/Data%28Do_Not_Push%29/Social%20Readjustment%20Scale%20Holmes%20and%20Rahe.pdf) of Holmes and Rahe (1967) per [Spurgeon etal.(2000)](https://github.com/medmatix/Dev_Data_Prod_Proj/blob/master/Data%28Do_Not_Push%29/Life%20Events%20Inventory%2C%20Occup%20Med%20%28Lond%29-2001-Spurgeon-287-93.pdf) which we are applying as the instrument for this survey.

##Methods
There are 4 components to the implementation of Web Data Application Project:

- Survey data input

- survey response handinging with responder feedback

- storage and/or forwartding of response record

- documentation

  - study and survey instrument background
  
  - user-responder documentation
  
  - investigation-user documentation (operation and maintenance)
  
  In addition there are support functions inherent in the Web Application itself which are technically extraneous to the basic (initial) Data Product Development assignment requirements.

The purpose of the presentation is the fulfillment of the requirements for a so called Pitch Presentation on the Life Stress and Illness Data Collection application. 

The Reproducible Pitch Presentation

The shiny app is completed, now it's time to make a pitch. Use 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

    Five slides to pitch the idea, done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
    Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
    A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box

Your presentation must satisfy the following

    It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
    It must be 5 pages
    It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
    It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line).

Rstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.

You can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.
